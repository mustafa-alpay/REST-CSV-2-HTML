# REST-CSV-2-HTML

Welcome to the REST-CSV-2-HTML wiki!

This is a simple Python CSV to HTML converter.

If you are using a MAC you can simply convert a CSV to HTML from terminal. MACs have already python installed.

From your terminal simply browse to your local directory in which this repository resides & simply type

cd CSV_directory

python csv2html.py test.csv

Where test.csv is your CSV file.

That's all.

Thanks.
